→ Then Deep Loss will breach

**No red warnings:**
→ Check barrier level vs scenario outcomes
→ Make sure it's RC product (not CPPN)
→ Try different barriers

**Checkpoints don't show:**
→ Make sure product has coupons (RC only)

→ Drag slowly over green dots

**Can't delete:**

→ Then click "Yes" in inline confirm
→ Then confirm in browser popup
